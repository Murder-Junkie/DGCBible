      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Age Requirement</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Players must be over the age of 18 to participate. No exceptions. If you are gaming on this server, we assume that you are 18. We are not liable for any adult language or content you might encounter.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Staff Communication</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Do <em>not</em> DM or ping staff for support or server questions. Open a support ticket instead. If you are in-game, use the <code>/ticket</code> command.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Behavior & Conduct</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Constant rule-breaking and toxic behavior will result in a ban. This is at the discretion of the staff team.</li>
          <li>Harassment, racism, sexism, trolling, drama, "must win" attitudes, or hateful speech of any kind will not be tolerated. This applies to Discord, all game servers, and players' streaming chats.</li>
          <li>This includes any use or variation of the hard "N" and hard "R" words.</li>
          <li>Respect other members. We aim to provide a positive space to game—help keep it that way.</li>
          <li>Do not troll in-character just to bait people. We are a semi-realistic RP server; please act accordingly.</li>
          <li>Be considerate of others' roleplay! Strive to create the best possible scenario for your fellow players. Interactions should benefit all players' RP experience.</li>
          <li>Win or lose, remember: this is for fun. When everyone is having fun, we all win.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Communication Rules</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Use of outside Discord servers, private voice chats, or third-party voice communication for in-character communication is prohibited while on FiveM.</li>
          <li>When communicating with anyone in-server, even if they are in the same Discord call, please mute and communicate in the city.</li>
          <li>Even if nobody else is around, someone may show up at any time.</li>
          <li><em>Example:</em> If you are in the DGC Discord general chat and talking to someone in-server, mute yourself or deafen to better immerse yourself in the roleplay scenario.</li>

      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Griefing</h3>

      <section>
        <h2>General</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>RP comes first in every situation. This is an RP server, and you must remain in character at all times. If there is a problem (including rule breaks), roleplay the scenario out and then bring it up afterwards via a support ticket.</li>
          <li>Voices cannot be used against anybody if masked or playing a different soul. If you recognize someone's voice in a robbery, you cannot use that recognition to get a warrant for their arrest or to retaliate against them. Only physical evidence can be used.</li>
          <li>Physical body cameras, phone cameras, and CCW are the only footage that can be used against a person as evidence in-character, and only for the Department of Justice.</li>
          <li>"Smart Glasses" and similar devices do not count and cannot be used as evidence.</li>
          <li>Audio can still be recorded for phone calls.</li>
          <li>You can use audio recording as a form of evidence, and LEO can set up stings using recordings.</li>
          <li><strong>Note:</strong> <code>/takes bodycam</code> no longer applies.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Respect and Value of Life</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Treat your life as if you have no respawns left. Your life is important, so protect it.</li>
          <li>No KOS (Kill on Sight) unless it is agreed upon between gangs in your respective territory, or both parties have made a mutual introduction and understand why combat is occurring.</li>
          <li>Do not RDM (Random Death Match) or VDM (Vehicle Death Match).</li>
          <li>You must value your character's life and the lives of other characters at all times. Your character's personality and mannerisms should portray fear when faced with a life threat.</li>
          <li>Do not harass or disrespect other members or management. Show respect to other players and keep real-life drama out of roleplay.</li>
          <li>Management has final say in all decisions and can take action without a player report.</li>
          <li>Toxicity in any form will not be tolerated.</li>
          <li>There is a zero-tolerance policy for Racism, Bestiality, Suicide, or Rape RP.</li>
          <li>Criminal activities (kidnapping, killing, robbing, etc.) are NOT allowed in Green Zones such as PD Station, Pillbox, City Hall, and civilian job sites like mines.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Streaming</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>ERP may not be streamed; it does not fall within most streaming TOS.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Stream sniping and metagaming will NOT be tolerated.</strong> The first offence is your last offence—we take this very seriously. Using a streamer’s live stream or VOD to gain information about storyline-specific in-game events is strictly prohibited and will result in a permanent ban from this server.</li>
          <li><strong>Watching or listening to a stream while in the FiveM server is up to the discretion of the streamer.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>If you are asked to leave the streamer’s channel while on the server, you must comply.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>If you are allowed to watch the channel while on the server, you must not be actively involved in player-to-player roleplay if speaking in their chat.</strong> Priority is to be shifted to the server.</li>
          <li><strong>Players who are directly involved in the roleplay on the server may not make suggestions to change the direction of the RP in a streamer’s channel.</strong> This can be considered meta and power gaming.</li>
          <li><strong>Speaking ill of other players, servers, admins/owners on stream or harassing streamers in their chat is not allowed.</strong> If there is an issue with someone, please submit a player complaint ticket so we can look into the issue further.</li>
          <li><strong>Players are not allowed to clip other players' streams to use against them in a player complaint ticket.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Using clips or highlights as evidence in RP:</strong> You must be using one of the following: the in-game cellphone, camcorder, or a clothing item that resembles a "body cam" on your character. Dashcam is allowed only if the camera is facing front, and you are in the vehicle.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Discord Rules</h2>
        <p><strong>Discord is considered OOC (Out of Character). Therefore, topics discussed there should never be used in-game.</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Do not send friend invites or DMs to other players who have not solicited them.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Do not DM (Direct Message) or tag any admin or mod. Create a Ticket instead.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Players are required to change their Discord "nicknames" to their character name(s).</strong></li>
          <li><strong>No starting drama or being toxic in any public OOC chat channels.</strong> If you have a problem with another player, make a support ticket and write "player complaint" in the issue part.</li>
          <li><strong>Do not stream snipe.</strong> You may not be in another player's live stream while logged into the server.</li>
          <li><strong>You must follow Discord's TOS.</strong></li>
          <li>Advertising of any sort will not be tolerated unless given explicit permission from an admin.</li>
          <li>Do not spam the bot. It has feelings too, ya know.</li>
          <li>Offensive/NSFW names and avatars are not allowed and will result in a warning.</li>
          <li><strong>Staff have the final say in what is allowed.</strong> They have the right to remove posts as they see fit.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Server Rules</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Players are required to always stay in-character while on the server.</strong> No OOC conversation will happen in-game unless explicitly asked by an admin.</li>
          <li><strong>All characters MUST be custom characters; no default model ("Mr. Clean/Default Dan") characters will be allowed</strong> (unless using a default model as a Patreon backer to access the PED room).</li>
          <li><strong>“Asset dumping" to another player or character, if you plan to leave the server, is not allowed.</strong> Players can't transfer assets to another player without prior in-character reasoning. Please contact the admin before leaving.</li>
          <li>Players are not allowed to transfer their own assets to their other personal characters (AKA Power gaming).</li>
          <li><strong>No Dismemberment RP.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>No sexual harassment or rape RP. Period.</strong> Making jokes about such things is also unacceptable.</li>
          <li><strong>No threatening or committing suicide without the permadeath of the character.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Players are not allowed to exactly replicate a character/likeness or story.</strong> Staff reserves the right to deem a story, character, or likeness too close to originals and can ask you to change it. If you are unsure if it is acceptable, please put in a ticket so staff can discuss.</li>
          <li><strong>Players cannot play a character that is under 18 years old.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Players cannot roleplay as supernatural creatures.</strong> (Example: a vampire is not realistic).</li>
          <li><strong>Serial killer characters are a "one and done" type character.</strong> Once caught with enough evidence for a trial and found guilty, the character MAY receive the death penalty.</li>
          <li><strong>Players cannot force permadeath on other players.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Faking your own death (fake permadeath) MUST be approved by staff prior to doing so.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>If a player plans to "coma" their character, this means it should be on a long-term basis, not just a day or two.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>No loitering</strong> in front of PD, Hospitals, middle of the road, or being AFK in public.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Fail RP</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Meta Gaming is prohibited and will result in a ban on the first offence.</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><em>Examples of metagaming:</em> Watching live/VOD streams to learn information about other characters or locations and using that information in roleplay. Also, any information learned from OOC chat on Discord.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Power Gaming will not be tolerated.</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <em>Examples of power gaming:</em>
                <ul>
                  <li>Hiding in a house or apartment (instance) to avoid an active roleplay scene.</li>
                  <li>Using other characters that aren't in a specific gang/group/investigation to help your own/friends' gang/group/investigation get further ahead.</li>
                  <li>Using any information learned on other characters and transferring it to other players by means of giving it back to yourself.</li>
                  <li>Logging out before finishing a scenario when being forced into a 48-hour coma to avoid giving players your requested items.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>RDM (Random Death Match) and/or VDM (Vehicle Death Match) against other players will not be tolerated.</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Running people over with a vehicle in ANY instance is VDM.</li>
              <li>VDM also applies to hitting other players’ cars in an attempt to damage, disable, or grief.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>All "hitman" actions must be carried out with a proper amount of RP.</strong> The player to be killed must understand that this may be coming to their character.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Players are not allowed to "combat log" to avoid punishment or being killed.</strong> (If your game crashes, you are required to come back and finish the scenario.)
            <ul>
              <li>
                <em>Examples of combat logging:</em>
                <ul>
                  <li>Being downed by police and disconnecting to avoid being arrested.</li>
                  <li>Being chased by police/criminals and logging out in the middle of the scenario.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Abusing game mechanics or exploits of any kind is NOT ALLOWED! This will result in a permanent ban.</strong> Any game exploits should be reported to developers if found. This includes any billing system if players are attempting to disguise their identity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Information that you hear through walls is not allowed to be used in roleplay.</strong> (This is a game mechanics issue.) You may only use information if your character is in the same room or hall as those other characters.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Communication is required before any gun fight or attack.</strong> This includes phone messages/instapic/Birdy with an apparent meaning or outright threat. This must be properly communicated/understood by the opposing players and not just sent out moments before an attack.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Making up treatments/injuries/changing scenarios for any RP to be presented as "evidence" for a legal case is power gaming and not allowed.</strong> All RP and evidence that can be used should be fully RP'd at the time of the incident (i.e., RPing injuries and providing documentation that day, not when asked for by a lawyer and made up on the spot).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Do not insert yourselves into other players' RP.</strong> If you were not directly involved with that scenario and/or directly affiliated with that crew/gang and/or are called to join in.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Do not do things that your character cannot physically do.</strong> <em>Examples:</em> Dropping items while handcuffed, using a phone or radio while tied up, stacking more than two on a motorcycle, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Unnecessarily escorting, cuffing, or carrying someone is not allowed.</strong> This includes doing these to gain an advantage over someone who is not in the downed state.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dragging a player around with the intent to not create RP and/or to annoy them is a bannable offence.</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Using a vehicle to flip over another vehicle is not allowed.</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>You must never spam the attacking/melee button on someone.</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Torture RP:</strong> You must receive consent from the other party that you are torturing through a /me to ensure they are okay with the actions happening to their character. If the player you are torturing responds with "/me Not ok with that" etc., you must attempt to end the scenario in a timely manner without pursuing more torture RP.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use of vehicles with unbreakable windows, extremely small windows, covered fronts, or that provide an advantage in shootouts cannot be used for criminal activity.</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Under no circumstances can a criminal force their victim to sell property, such as houses, vehicles, or businesses.</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>You are not allowed to demand someone to hand over ownership of their vehicle, but you can demand the spare keys to a vehicle.</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Demanding someone to withdraw money from their bank account via an ATM, bank, or phone is not allowed.</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Combat & Roleplay Logging</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Players are not allowed to disconnect or respawn from a roleplay or combat situation that could have in-character consequences. This includes respawning during an active scenario.</li>
          <li>If your game crashes, you must reconnect to the server and continue roleplaying the scenario that you were in.</li>
          <li>While in combat, you are not allowed to use emotes (such as passout, sleep, etc.) to your advantage.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Fear For Life</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fear RP:</strong> If your character is held at gunpoint, you need to fear for your life. Don't run away; play out the scenario with your captors. (Guns must be present, not just yelling you have guns behind tinted windows or in your pocket.)</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Choosing not to Fear RP:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>If you decide not to fear for your life because you want to play your character as a fearless loose cannon-if you run away or fight back with guns pointed at you and end up losing the fight-you are required to go into an automatic 24-hour coma.</li>
              <li>The scenario must be finished out with whoever has you in custody in RP (you cannot talk in this state, only use /me's or /do's).</li>
              <li>Once downed, your character cannot remember any of the scenarios of why you are in the coma (New Life Rule).</li>
              <li>This is your choice: either comply and remember what the aggressors looked like/what they were driving/etc (Fear for Life), or get killed and not remember anything while putting that character on the back burner for 24 hours.</li>
              <li>If we see that character in the city before the 24-hour period is over, it will result in an automatic strike-no questions asked.</li>
              <li>(If a person doesn't fear and this happens, please do a /report at the time and open a ticket.)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Power Shift:</strong> If you are being held at gunpoint and someone else in your crew or someone directly involved in the scenario gets the opportunity to take their own hostage (for example, 2 kidnappers, but the one not holding the hostage gets held up by another person) or gets the gunman at gunpoint, this is considered a power shift. Now the odds have balanced to a 1 hostage vs 1 hostage. Negotiations to end this with no bullets can now begin. Not fearing for your partner's life is Fail RP.</li>
          <li><strong>Example:</strong> Mac goes to the bank by Pink Cage looking for a hostage for a Pacific bank robbery and sees Julian standing next to his car. Mac hops out and tells Julian to put his hands up and get in the car. Mac has his back to the doors and Lukas, who was inside putting money away, holds Mac up from behind. Mac knows this is a failed scenario and keeps Julian in his sights and says he will leave peacefully, as he makes his way back into his car and drives off. If they choose to follow him, that's on them, but no bullets were fired and the scenario has ended.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>New Life Rule (NLR)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>New Life Rule:</strong> Triggered once you are incapacitated and respawn at the hospital; the cause of death is irrelevant. Getting yourself downed is not considered as dying; therefore, once you get treated by EMS, the new life rule is not triggered. You lose all memory from the scenario if you respawn by using "E".</li>
          <li><strong>After you are incapacitated, you cannot talk about your death through in-character channels unless an individual/party informs you through RP.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Once a player becomes incapacitated, they cannot come back to the area of their death for 30 minutes</strong> and they cannot take hostile action against the party responsible for their death for 60 minutes. They also lose every roleplay reason to take hostile action against the party responsible for their death.</li>
          <li><strong>Another player is not able to decide when another permanently kills their character; this is decided upon OOC</strong> and once agreed, they can commence with the scenario. You are allowed to plan out a scenario OOC if you decide on permaing (killing your character).</li>
          <li><strong>If you are downed in a scenario and it has ended, you are not allowed to return to the area of the scene to collect evidence, loot bodies, etc.</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Value of Life</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Value Of Life:</strong> You must value your life similar to the way you do your own in real life. For example, you must not engage in a gunfight for the fun of it, knowing that you would not do it IRL. At all times, you must value your life as if it were your last. If you are at a clear disadvantage (for example, a gun pointed to the back of your head while you are looking the other way), you must comply with their demands.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>If you are outnumbered 3 to 1 you must:</strong> comply. This does not mean that you do not have an option to try and escape. When possible and in a correct situation, you have the option to try and escape.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Example of an escape attempt:</strong> if you are being held hostage in front of a bank and decide to run away even though the person has a firearm ready.

        <h2>Roleplaying Your Injuries</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>If you are hurt, you must RP your injuries and roleplay them realistically.</strong></li>
          <li>Your character wouldn't be able to run if you have a broken leg—use a wheelchair.</li>
          <li>RP out head injuries by being loopy or have someone take care of you.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>When you are downed during a scenario and require medical RP, you are officially out of that scenario.</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>(RP your injuries, go to a different cop call, but you can't return to the scenario that you were downed in.)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Players are not to communicate while downed or in an instance where they could be realistically incapacitated</strong> (head injury, shot to head, "knocked out", etc.). Pain responses to EMS/LEO when asked are allowed but must be realistic.
            While downed, you cannot use your phone/radio to communicate or tell your location to other players (e.g., tweets, OOC, /me). Moans, groans, and grunts in proximity are allowed, but not over radio.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>When downed, do NOT force respawn unless absolutely necessary.</strong> Allow EMS, police, or other players to resolve through RP. You will lose all your items if you force respawn.
          </li>

        <h2>Meta-Gaming</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Meta-Gaming:</strong> This is when you use real-life information gained from outside the game to benefit your character's knowledge in-game, even though they would not have known this information.</li>
          <li><strong>Players are not to engage in "meta-profiling".</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Proper evidence MUST be obtained of that character's involvement in the situation in question in order to create further investigation.</strong></li>
          <li>Requesting help from your allies through out-of-character channels is not allowed.</li>
          <li>While in the city, you are not permitted to be in a livestream (such as Discord, Twitch, Facebook Gaming, & YouTube) of another player.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Examples of meta-profiling include:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>Jill wearing pink combat boots; players must not assume Jill's involvement without proper investigation.</li>
              <li>Recognizing Sam's voice during a crime scene; cannot link the character to the crime without evidence.</li>
            </ol>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Players cannot steal EMS or LEO vehicles.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>LEO vehicles and trunks may not be robbed of any weapons.</strong></li>
          <li>It is illegal to chop your own vehicle or gang/business vehicles; this is a strikable exploit.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Shooting from vehicles while driving at high speeds is prohibited.</strong> Drivebys require prior RP and must occur at 20mph or less; shooting from cars to cars is limited to 50mph or lower.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Removing plates on cars from the extras menu to commit crimes or hide illegal acts is against the rules.</strong> Using such scripts results in a strike.

        <h2>General Gang Guidelines and Rules</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Do not force people to change the colors of their vehicles, clothing, or hair.</strong> You may only use colors to identify your organization or gang. Only one organization or gang may identify with an individual color at a time.</li>
          <li><strong>Gang members may not kill players</strong> who are not associated with a registered gang or considered solo, unless attacked or provoked by the non-gang player.</li>
          <li><strong>Gang members may not "blackout" to avoid gang affiliation being known.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Failure to abide by any of the rules will risk all members of a gang losing their gang status or even earning subsequent server bans.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>These guidelines are subject to change at any time; an announcement will be made upon changes.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Players are not allowed to have two souls in the same group/gang.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>No gang jumping:</strong> If you leave a gang you have to wait 2 weeks to join a different gang. If at that time you join another gang, you can't gang jump for another month.</li>

        <h2>Gang Leader</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Each gang leader is expected to make sure that their gang members are following server rules.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>You (as a leader) should only be recruiting trustworthy people, and as such, they are your responsibility, not the server admin or development teams.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Gang leader accountability:</strong> Fines and/or jail time will be brought onto the gang leader if any of their members break a rule. Management has final say on decisions. Warnings will be issued. A 3rd strike will warrant a 5-day disband of the gang (no gang-related activities, i.e., turf wars, on sights, tagging).</li>
          <li><strong>Each leader should make sure that whoever is recruiting may not be in another gang, or have another character in a rival gang.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Each gang can't have more than 16 members.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Gang leaders should register their gang in a ticket and provide the required info.</strong></li>

        <h2>Gang Conflict</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Gang conflict may only start over real roleplay reasons.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>All gang violence should be avoided in green zones (i.e., PD / Pillbox) and community-posted event locations.</strong> This also includes civilian job locations, illegal spots (labs, materials fields, black markets).</li>
          <li><strong>If a fight is initiated,</strong> it must be taken outside of green zones and both parties must agree (fist fights only, no other weapons).</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Gang Activity</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>You are not allowed to take 100% of everything from a gang storage if you decide to leave.</strong> Wiping out an entire gang storage isn't fair to other players. 50% will be allowed, but please note there will be NO LIMIT on the gang you robbed getting back at you, and a clip of the scene will need to be provided in a support ticket.</li>
          <li>Temporary alliances are accepted within RP reason.</li>
          <li><strong>On sight gang war scenes must be set up through the #scene-setup channel in Discord.</strong> All gang leaders must be approved and all parties must be notified. (24/7 Birdy and in-city social media may be used for smaller scale on-sight scenes that may eventually erupt into a gang war, at which point a post should then be made in the #scene-setup channel.)</li>
          <li><strong>Do not spray other gang tags if you are not in that gang;</strong> only your own tag or general non-gang related text may be used.</li>
          <li><strong>Do not spray any government building.</strong> (PD, Hospitals, City Hall)</li>
          <li>If a gang has been temporarily disbanded, active gang members will acknowledge those members as civilians.</li>
          <li><strong>Do not use a place of business or an apartment/house to avoid conflict.</strong> You cannot create a scene then go somewhere to lock the doors; it is unsportsmanlike and interferes with the scene, so this will be considered FRP.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Criminal</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Before killing another player you must have at least a 15 second interaction.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>You have 24 hours to get your revenge on another player.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>THRUSTERS ARE NOT TO BE USED FOR ANY CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES. IT WILL BE REMOVED FROM YOUR GARAGE AND YOU WILL BE JAILED.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>No beefing with EMS over them doing their jobs.</strong> Respect their RP (e.g., informing cops of criminals checking in to Pillbox if police are actively looking for them). If you have an issue, put in a support ticket—don't break scene.</li>
          <li><strong>Do not use a garage to store or take out your vehicle or hide in an apartment/house if you are in a chase to avoid punishment from the police.</strong> This will result in a strike.</li>
          <li><strong>You cannot cop bait.</strong> Driving around the police station to get them to chase you or general harassment of police is prohibited.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Robbing Downed Players:</strong> To rob a downed player you must have been involved in, or be in the gang that was involved in, the scene. If you come across a downed player in your travels you may not rob them. Robbing of a player's inventory items is allowed but must be roleplayed correctly.
            <ul>
              <li>Cannot take more than 50% of their inventory.</li>
              <li>NO ROBBING PEOPLE ON CRUTCHES.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>You cannot interfere in robberies.</strong> For example, if X is doing a Pacific Standard heist, you cannot enter the bank without permission from X party. You are also not allowed to interfere under the reasoning of "revenge"; this includes, but is not limited to, interfering because your friend was taken hostage.</li>
          <li><strong>You may choose to follow people who have just robbed the bank with the intention to rob the money for yourself.</strong> You must, however, have RP before resorting to shootouts.</li>
          <li><strong>Scamming must be done in-game by roleplaying it.</strong> Scamming people through out-of-character channels is not allowed; this includes scamming someone by telling them the incorrect server command for personal gain.</li>
          <li><strong>6-man rule: Criminal activities are limited to 6 players max at a time.</strong> This means that no outside help is allowed in any sort of way. Whoever you bring to the scenario is who you have until it is completely played out. This includes anyone giving information to the scenario (lookouts, radio comms, etc.).</li>
          <li><strong>Shooting cooldown, regardless of scenario type, is 10 mins.</strong> (Unless agreed upon by both parties.)</li>
          <li><strong>Criminals must provide a proper reasoning during initiation before shooting police officers.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>No drug selling at any player-owned business/shop.</strong> If caught on bodycam, PD has the right to raid and shut down the business for up to 1 week.</li>
          <li>If you are being robbed and run into the PD station or Hospital, robbery must stop.</li>

        <h2>Kidnappings / Hostages</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>DO NOT kidnap LEO (Law Enforcement Officer) or EMS.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Players cannot be kidnapped from inside a greenzone.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Hostages cannot be held longer than 30 minutes</strong> unless the scenario progresses and all parties involved are pleased with the scenario.</li>
          <li><strong>You can't kidnap or rob the same player repeatedly;</strong> this can be classified as griefing.</li>
          <li><strong>Hostages should be put in the trunk of a car/SUV</strong> (if 4 seats are taken, use the trunk).</li>
          <li><strong>Hostages are NOT to be carried on a motorcycle.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Hostages must not be willing participants for hostage takers.</strong> If caught, all players will be subject to punishment.</li>
          <li><strong>Fake hostages are not allowed.</strong> You must plan robberies the correct way!</li>

        <h2>Robberies</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>You cannot rob government employees (LEO, DOJ, EMS) strictly for the purpose of obtaining their belongings.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Players can only be robbed of their belongings and money on them,</strong> not their bank account.</li>
          <li><strong>NO POCKET WIPES:</strong> Players cannot steal every item from a single player's pocket; items must make sense for the RP. No more than 50% of inventory and no playtime shop guns.</li>
          <li><strong>All items in vehicles are fair game, including playtime shop guns.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Players must be "held up/hands up" in order to be robbed.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Do not camp job sites to steal from other players' pockets</strong> (i.e., material theft, but kidnapping is fine).</li>
          <li><strong>When doing a robbery, only the criminals who originally set up the job can be involved.</strong> No outside help can come at any time; this includes a car chase or a shootout (no radioing for backup or a pickup).</li>
          <li><strong>Motorcycles may not be parked inside of a building.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>If LEOs/criminals/gang members have a shooter in the bushes/across the street, they are required to announce their presence</strong> (but not their location), so it isn't considered RDM. Unarmed lookouts do not have to be announced.</li>
          <li><strong>You may rob 1 store clerk every 10 minutes;</strong> this prevents chain robbing and unrealistic criminal activity.</li>
          <li><strong>Criminals can no longer "shoot out" cameras in bank robberies.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Up to 6 criminals/gang members are allowed to commit crime together at one time</strong> (drug deals, kidnappings, gang activities, house robberies, etc.).</li>
          <li>
            <strong>There must be:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>1 officer to hold up a shop owner and NPC muggings.</li>
              <li>2 officers on duty to do a jewelry/store robbery.</li>
              <li>3 officers for Fleeca Bank and Pacific Standard.</li>

        <h2>Police Rules & LEO Specific</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>LEOs are encouraged</strong> to give tickets to players standing around not moving from a single location for extended periods of time ("loitering").</li>
          <li><strong>Officers that are not wearing "body cam" will be held to the same standards as all other Civs when it comes to player or scenario reports.</strong> No evidence = admin discretion of what to do with the situation.</li>
          <li><strong>If an LEO RPs that you are cuffed while down or to a hospital bed, you must RP that you are unable to move from that location/are handcuffed.</strong> Running away is failRP.</li>
          <li><strong>If an officer responds to a gang battle event area, be prepared to be shot.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>If you can't see the plate on the car or the car doesn't have a plate, the car can't be ID'd using the automatic license plate reader.</strong> If a vehicle is found parked or impounded, police need to physically RP out checking VIN numbers to get plate numbers.</li>
          <li><strong>If a player has a cop & family member/friend is in a gang, you cannot directly involve yourself in gang related investigations that involve your family member/friends.</strong> This would be considered meta/power gaming.</li>
          <li><strong>Camping or staking out an area where you can start/commit a crime is not allowed.</strong> You are allowed to check the area/availability, but afterwards you must leave the area for at least 5 minutes before returning.</li>
          <li><strong>Gun licenses require a background check and fingerprint processing prior to purchase.</strong> If an individual is caught with no license, the gun will be taken away. If it is a Playtime Shop gun, the officer will hold onto the owner’s gun until the correct license is purchased. (Officer will hold onto playtime gun for max 2 weeks)</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Corruption:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Low level police corruption is allowed under sergeant level only.</strong> Above this rank, corruption is not allowed.</li>
              <li><strong>No EMS or LEO corruption is allowed while on duty.</strong></li>
              <li><strong>The selling of PD weapons and physical evidence (i.e., weapons, drugs, etc.) is not allowed.</strong> If caught, it will result in IC being fired from PD and an OOC strike. Low level corruption is allowed, just not the sale of equipment.</li>

        <h2>DOJ Rules</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>A Bench trial for a criminal case requires that the charges be sufficiently serious, entail a reasonable amount of jail time, and not have arisen through any server rule violations and/or that the individual requesting the trial is known and trusted to deliver a high standard of RP.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>The DOJ shall have final say on filing a request to the court to hold a bench trial and may choose to deny it for OOC misconduct if deemed relevant.</strong></li>
          <li>A defendant may have only one bench trial active at a time and:</li>
          <li><strong>They shall receive automatic bail subject to a withholding bond payable in cash or assets (if cars, they are impounded. If houses, a lien is placed, but they do not need to lose access).</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Any further crimes they commit whilst on bail may be admitted into evidence. You will go straight to jail for those crimes.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>A Government forum section would exist for the court docket. Pleading papers would be filed there and processed by a judge.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Trial dates will be arranged OOCly for all parties to be able to attend.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Lawyers must pass a bar examination. A Defendant may opt for pro-se representation (self-representation).</strong></li>
          <li><strong>All cases are public. For any evidence to be "sealed" it must be motioned for, approved by a judge, and held in a protected forum area. A party may motion for it to be unsealed.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Crimes for Perjury, Practicing Law without a license, and Contempt of Court would be added. These charges may only be filed by or at the request of a judge.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Multiple defendants involved in the same scenario wishing to be tried in court shall all be tried together for the same charges under the same case regardless of whether they only committed a subset of the entire count of charges. This could change in future if there are sufficient DOJ players to process cases. If you don't like it, opt out of the trial and go straight to jail.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Real US case law may be presented for the purpose of setting precedent, as may prior in-game cases.</strong></li>
          <li>
            <strong>The structure of a criminal case would be as follows:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>The DOJ files a bench trial demand on the forum.</li>
              <li>A Judge reviews, stamps, and signs the paper, sending a government forum PM to the defendant with the court summons and including the demand document from the DOJ.</li>
              <li>The defendant or their lawyer may file a response acknowledging the summons and motioning for discovery within a reasonable deadline.</li>
              <li>A judge will review the response (if any) and grant, deny, or permit with modifications/conditions, the response.</li>
              <li>The prosecution must then provide any materials motioned for-almost certainly whatever they intend to admit into evidence.</li>
              <li>Depositions may be conducted by either side. Anyone refusing to be depositioned or surrender evidence may be subpoenaed, subject to a judge approving the subpoena. Witnesses must be subpoenaed to also appear unless the defense will depositional evidence. OOC cooperation is key here; attempting to hold up the trial because a witness can't be summoned should not be tolerated. Nonetheless, the right to confront your accusers should be adhered to as best as possible.</li>
              <li>A pro-se defendant may bring one person to assist them, but all communications with the court must be conducted by the defendant.</li>
              <li>
                The legal standard for conviction for each count is that of being beyond all reasonable doubt. The trial date occurs and is conducted thus:
                <ul>
                  <li>Everyone, excepting on-duty law enforcement, must be unarmed in court. Any uninvolved LEO may act as bailiff.</li>
                  <li>The judge calls the session to order, anyone who will be involved in the case(s) are sworn in and parties are instructed to communicate only with the presiding judge. The defendant is asked to enter their plea for each count; a plea of Guilty or Nolo Contendere for all charges shall terminate the case immediately and they shall be taken to serve them.</li>
                  <li>Opening statements are made by the prosecution and defense. No interruptions.</li>
                  <li>Evidence and witness testimony is referred to. Either side may announce objections and they shall be sustained or overruled. The defense must be permitted to cross-examine witnesses and question any evidence.</li>
                  <li>Closing statements are made by the prosecution and defense. No interruptions.</li>
                  <li>The judge retires to deliberate and returns to deliver their verdict on each individual count and the defendant is either imprisoned or released.</li>
                  <li>Where possible, a transcript or video recording of the trial should be made and attached to the case file before it is closed.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Civil cases would follow a similar format, except:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>Cases are more heavily paperwork based, all parties shall have full knowledge of the evidence/testimony the opposing side intends to present in court.</li>
              <li>Filing a case is subject to a fee. The court shall have the power to declare an individual as a vexatious litigant and disallow them from filing civil cases for an appropriate period of time and optionally charge them with Contempt of Court.</li>
              <li>Plaintiffs may apply for relief in the form of money or tangible goods. If assets are seized and sold to cover a monetary amount, the plaintiff shall only receive the guaranteed amount.</li>
              <li>Assets purchased through the credit store shall not ICly be considered.</li>
              <li>Deliberately transferring assets to avoid paying shall fall under Contempt of Court. Assisting parties shall also be liable for the same charge.</li>
              <li>The case shall be considered based on a preponderance of the evidence. This is a lower level than beyond all reasonable doubt and standard for civil cases.</li>

          <li><strong>Treat patients in order of call received.</strong></li>

        <h2>Business</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Players MUST utilize and create RP for whitelisted jobs while they are on duty.</strong> This includes mechanics, EMS, police, taxi services, etc.</li>
          <li><strong>If you paid IRL or in-game money for any business/house/mansion and have not been active for 30 days without warning, the city will foreclose it and sell it to the next owner.</strong> This INCLUDES lifetime owned businesses.</li>
          <li><strong>No player should exploit or abuse their job actions/items.</strong></li>
          <li>
            <strong>Examples (but not limited to):</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>Mechanics hijacking vehicles to steal items in the vehicle.</li>
              <li>Mechanics caught doing so will be stripped of their job, jailed, and blacklisted from every shop in the city.</li>

            </ol>
          </li>
          <li><strong>No player shall steal or abuse businesses or society funds (It breaks the economy and kills RP for player-owned business).</strong></li>
          <li>
            <strong>Examples (but not limited to):</strong>
            <ol>

        <h2>Established Citizen</h2>
        <p><strong>WHAT'S AN ESTABLISHED CITIZEN?</strong><br>
          Role-playing is about creating stories with fellow players. Everyone is encouraged to get to know people, participate in or coordinate server-wide events, and engage with others in ways that provide a fun, enjoyable experience for all. Quality RP benefits the community as a whole. Established Citizens are players who have been formally recognized for their dedication to community-building and engagement.
        </p>
        <p><strong>WHY WOULD I WANT TO BECOME AN ESTABLISHED CITIZEN?</strong><br>
          Players who have proven they are dependable, trustworthy, and have taken the time to establish a name for themselves and their characters have the opportunity to become Established Citizens. Established Citizens enjoy extra in-game benefits such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Allowed to own property on the server and see properties for sale.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>The option to manage/own a business.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Gain access to established citizen Discord roles and chats.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Allowed to vote in "community voting" sessions.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How Do I BECOME AN ESTABLISHED CITIZEN?</strong><br>
          To become an Established Citizen requires time and effort. It's not difficult, but it won't happen overnight either. This is a reward system for players who have proven they are dependable and will stick around on the server. Don't expect to become an Established Citizen in the first week.

        <h2>Maintaining Activity on the Server</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Players in owner positions are required to be active in-server at least 2-3 days weekly to maintain their departments. Staff discretion will be used for removal of players from those roles due to inactivity.</li>
          <li>If you are the leader of a gang/organization and you are inactive for a month, but the group is still active within the server, the group will be handed off to the secondary higher-up player in said group at the discretion of staff.</li>
          <li>Inactive gangs and businesses will be migrated to other players or removed after a month of inactivity at the discretion of the staff team.</li>
          <li>If you manage a business, it is your responsibility to keep your society account filled, pay your employees, and hire players into said business.</li>
          <li>If a player leaves the server, it is up to the discretion of the staff team to sell or foreclose on any property they may have invested in after 1 month of inactivity (unless the player notifies staff of a temporary departure).</li>

        <h2>Consequences of being Banned or Leaving</h2>
        <p>The server databases undergo routine maintenance and cleanup every two months. During this maintenance, perma'd characters or characters of players who have left or been removed-and all of those characters' in-game assets (money, cars, property, etc.)-are deleted.</p>
        <p>This is done to reduce server load and free up resources for active players. Once a character and its assets are wiped from the databases, there is no way to recover them.</p>
        <p>If you are banned from the server, your character(s) and all of your in-game assets are forfeit. They will be wiped from the server database during the maintenance cycle following your ban. In the event your ban is lifted and you are allowed to return, you will be required to start over as if your character(s) were brand new.</p>
        <p>If you choose to leave for more than two months without taking a formal leave of absence or otherwise notifying the Owners of your intent to return, your character(s) and all in-game assets may be wiped from the database during routine maintenance. If you need to take a break for OOC reasons and you intend to return, be sure to keep in touch so that your character(s) and assets are not deleted.</p>
